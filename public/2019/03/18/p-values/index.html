<p><strong>Intended level and assumed knowledge</strong>: <em>We figure you know a little about probability, a little about R, a little about hypothesis testing and statistics. We’d like to show you how these fit together. If you’re unfamiliar with these concepts, the footnotes will be your guide (some of the time).</em></p>

<h2>And so it begins..</h2>
<p><em>Our location: an office somewhere in Sydney, Australia. It might be well-appointed corporate digs, a slightly underfunded academic building or a cheap cafe somewhere in central Sydney. Choose your own statistical adventure.</em><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>John</strong>: Where do you want to start Steph?</p>
<p><strong>Steph</strong>: I don’t know, John. I have a lot of pent up rage. Let’s break something.</p>
<p><strong>John</strong>: We both know you have issues, Steph. We could take a stab<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> at
making sense of the reproducibility of experiments, prediction, and pre-registration?
Even better, we could take a stab at <em>truth</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Steph</strong>: Literally?</p>
<p><strong>John</strong>: Figuratively. We could look at hypothesis testing. We planned to do something useful, remember?</p>
<p><strong>Steph</strong>: OK, let’s break a hypothesis test. But these concepts are all really complex. Explain it like … I’m a management consultant. There should be a powerpoint and a snappy title.</p>
<p><strong>John</strong>: No chance. I’ll explain it like I’m a professor of statistics.</p>
<p><strong>Steph</strong>: My way is funnier. You and Microsoft SmartArt. Just give me five minutes to put a bet down with your grad students.</p>
<p><strong>John</strong>: My way at least makes sense and has an actual point.</p>
<p><strong>Steph</strong>: Fair call. OK, go!</p>
<p><strong>John</strong>: Alright, it started a few years ago. People started looking into whether
particular bits of medical research were reproducible. In particular
<span class="citation">Ioannidis (<a href="#ref-Ioannidis2005">2005</a>)</span> tried to reproduce 49 famous medical publications from
1990-2003 resulting from randomized trials: 45 claimed successful
intervention;</p>
<ul>
<li>7 (16%) were contradicted;</li>
<li>7 others (16%) found effect sizes were exaggerated;</li>
<li>20 (44%) were replicated; and</li>
<li>11 (24%) remained largely unchallenged.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>John</strong>: There were a number of other papers too, like <span class="citation">Pashler and Wagenmakers (<a href="#ref-PashlerWagenmakers2012">2012</a>)</span>.
The common theme between all of these papers, statistically speaking, is hypothesis testing.</p>
<p>One approach to fixing this problem is to pre-register hypothesis testing procedures.</p>
<p><strong>Steph</strong>: This plan was not dreamed up by management consultants. Why did they take that approach?</p>
<p><strong>John</strong>: Well people tended to play around with their analysis by playing
games with statistics to get statistical significance (usually <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-values
below 0.05). Pre-registration is the idea that forces researchers to pre-specify
how they will analyse their data before they collect it to stop this from happening.</p>
<p><strong>Steph</strong>: And yet we do it all the time with exploratory analysis.</p>
<p><strong>John</strong>: But causal inference needs a different approach.</p>
<p><strong>Steph</strong>: I agree, but as the person who wanted to stab a theoretical concept earlier in this conversation, I can think of a whole bunch of ways this can go wrong.</p>
<p><strong>John</strong>: Exactly. It’s really imperfect, but I think it would help to explain <em>why</em> that’s the case.</p>
<p><strong>Steph</strong>: You know what this dialogue needs, John?</p>
<p><strong>John</strong>: You’re going to tell me, whether I want to hear it or not.</p>
<p><strong>Steph</strong>: Relateable examples, mate.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>John</strong> (thinks): OK so a few years ago my wife was rear-ended while driving and the
car was written off so we needed to buy a new car. While we were looking to
get a new car my sister in law asked (as a joke) “Are you getting a red car?
I heard they’re fast!”</p>
<p><img src="/post/2019-03-18-break-tests1_files/lamborghini_huracan_slideshow_lead.jpg" alt="lamborghini_huracan" style="width:80.0%" />
<img src="![]()" style="width:90%"></p>
<p><strong>John</strong>: Now I don’t know much about cars at all. So if I went into a
car yard I wouldn’t want to buy one that looked like this.</p>
<p><strong>Steph</strong>: Honestly, John, it’s really not your style. You’re totally not doing the whole mid life crisis thing.</p>
<p><strong>John</strong>: Fast cars are also expensive cars! But that’s not the point.</p>
<p><strong>Steph</strong>: Your midlife crisis is not the point?</p>
<p><strong>John</strong>: I’m not having a midlife crisis.</p>
<p><strong>Steph</strong>: You’re an academic statistician who just started a blog with a management consultant.</p>
<p><strong>John</strong>: My judgement is lacking sometimes. There’s a point to this post though- I wanted to look at a bunch of ways to mess around with hypothesis tests in order
to get them to break.</p>
<p>My first example related to my sister in law’s joke.</p>
<p>By <em>break</em> I mean that the results of the hypothesis test are misleading - I want to create a situation where the test is telling us there is a difference between
two things when in fact no difference exists in reality.</p>
<p><strong>Steph</strong>: <em>Bayesians</em>. Let’s do this, let’s break some hypothesis tests. I might be the frequentist in this conversation, but the fact is that inference is really, really breakable in the field, so I think this is inherently useful. Bring on the cars!</p>

<div id="red-cars-are-faster4" class="section level1">
<h1>Red cars are faster!<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></h1>
<p>Let’s imagine a simplified world, such as is suitable for management consultants and students of statistics:</p>
<p>Suppose that<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>There are only two car colours -
<span style="color:red"><strong>red</strong></span> cars and
<span style="color:blue"><strong>blue</strong></span> cars
and we describe them with the variable <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{colour}_i\)</span>;</p></li>
<li><p>Cars can eiher be <span style="color:purple"><strong>sports</strong></span> cars or
<span style="color:green"><strong>normal</strong></span> cars;
and we represent them with the variable <span class="math inline">\(\mbox{type}_i\)</span>;</p></li>
<li><p><span style="color:purple"><strong>Sports</strong></span> cars
are more likely to be <span style="color:red"><strong>red</strong></span>
than <span style="color:green"><strong>normal</strong></span> cars</p></li>
<li><p><span style="color:purple"><strong>Sports</strong></span> cars
are generally faster than
<span style="color:green"><strong>normal</strong></span> cars.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The relationship between the three variables can
be visualized by a directed acyclic graph.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p>There are three nodes: type, colour and speed. The car type “causes”
the car colour and the car speed so there is a directed
edge from type to colour and type to speed. We can visualize this
using the <code>dagitty</code> and <code>ggdag</code> packages <span class="citation">(Textor and van der Zander <a href="#ref-R-dagitty">2016</a>,<span class="citation">@R-ggdag</span>)</span>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(dagitty)
library(ggdag)

dagified &lt;- dagify(colour ~ type,
                   speed ~ type,
                   exposure = &quot;colour&quot;,
                   outcome = &quot;speed&quot;)

</div>
<p><strong>Steph</strong>: That was all a bit <em>mathy</em>, but the general upshot is that we created a little facsimile of the world, one in which there are two types of cars (sports and normal), two colours of cars (blue and red) and cars have a speed that depends on their type. Then we represented it with some circles and lines that describe what those relationships are.</p>
</div>
<div id="simulating-data" class="section level1">
<h1>Simulating data</h1>
<p>Let’s put some numbers around this to create a concrete example: something measurable that we can test, and then show how and where a hypothesis test can (and does) get it wrong.</p>
<p>Let’s say that each type of car is equally likely:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{rl}
{\mathbb P}( \mbox{sports car}  ) = 0.5 \\
{\mathbb P}( \mbox{normal car}  ) = 0.5 \\
\end{array}
\]</span></p>
<p>Next, let’s say that the probability of a sports car being red is higher than for a normal car.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{rl}
{\mathbb P}( \mbox{red car} | \mbox{sports car}  ) &amp; = 0.8, \\
{\mathbb P}( \mbox{blue car} | \mbox{sports car}  ) &amp; = 0.2, \\
{\mathbb P}( \mbox{red car} | \mbox{normal car}  ) &amp; = 0.2, \qquad \mbox{and} \\
{\mathbb P}( \mbox{blue car} | \mbox{normal car}  ) &amp; = 0.8. \\
\end{array}
\]</span></p>
<p>Finally, suppose that normal cars travel on average <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0 = 100\)</span>km/h,
with sports cars travelling on average <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1 = 50km/h\)</span> higher,
with the same standard deviation of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma=25\)</span>km/h.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
<p>Now, say there are lots of cars in the world. Statistics is usually about understanding patterns in repeated things. Then we can simulate the speed of the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th car, where <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is just any arbitrary car, as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{array}{rl}
\mbox{speed}_i 
&amp;  = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times {\mathbb I}(\mbox{type}_i=\mbox{sports}) + \varepsilon_i  
\\
&amp;  = 100 + 50 \times {\mathbb I}(\mbox{type}_i=\mbox{sports}) + \varepsilon_i 
\end{array}
\]</span>
where independently <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon_i \sim N(0,25^2)\)</span>.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>Steph</strong>: John, you know that some people exist who are allergic to maths, right? So to translate, you made up a situation where the speed of the car is
only is related to the colour of the car because
red cars are more likely to be sports cars.</p>
<p><strong>John</strong>: Exactly, and this is going to be relevant later.</p>
<p>Let’s simulate some data<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> that captures this scenario using R <span class="citation">(R Core Team <a href="#ref-R-base">2018</a>)</span>.</p>

  )</code></pre>
<p><strong>Steph</strong>: Car type - where’s the car type?</p>
<p><strong>John</strong>: We’re going to break this hypothesis test by dropping
an important variable.</p>
<p><strong>Steph</strong>: Breaking, just like I asked for. Great. I note we’re breaking frequentist stuff first.</p>
<p><strong>John</strong>: We’re also simulating a podcast here, for reasons unknown.</p>
</div>
<div id="boxplots-and-two-sample-t-tests-11" class="section level1">
<h1>Boxplots and two sample t-tests<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></h1>
<p>Now that we have simulated some data we can create boxplots to get a view of the differences between the cars. Then we can try some statistical tests. If we make a boxplot for speed against colour we get:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>p &lt;- ggplot(tib, aes(x=colour, y=speed, fill=colour)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_bw()
p</code></pre>
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:fig-margin2"></span>

<p class="caption">
Figure 2: speed vs colour
</p>
</div>
<p>We can see that there appears to be a clear difference between the speeds of
red and blue cars from the boxplots.</p>
<p><strong>Steph</strong>: If we saw this result in exploratory analysis in the field, this would be our signal to keep digging. And that’s where domain knowledge wins every time, John. At this point in a real piece of field work, as a corporate data scientist, I want my analysts to be jumping up and down at me telling me this isn’t a real causal effect.</p>
<p><strong>John</strong>: That’s true, this is a simulated, simplified reality. Out of interest, do they often jump up and down when you’re around?</p>
<p><strong>Steph</strong>: I run a high energy team. Let’s pretend like we don’t understand that there isn’t a real relationship between speed and colour. Let’s say we <em>don’t</em> understand the causal relationships between the variables and we go ahead and do a test.</p>
<p>To quantify the difference a two sample <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-test could be used.</p>
<p>We have two sets of points - one for red cars, one for blue cars:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
{\bf r} = (r_1,\ldots,r_n) \qquad \mbox{and} \qquad {\bf b} = (b_1,\ldots,b_m),
\]</span>
these correspond to the speeds of the red and blue cars respectively.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>
<p>We assume that both the <span class="math inline">\({\bf r}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\({\bf b}\)</span> samples are
normally distributed:
<span class="math display">\[
r_i \stackrel{iid.}{\sim} N(\mu_1,\sigma^2), 
\qquad \mbox{and} \qquad
b_i \stackrel{iid.}{\sim} N(\mu_2,\sigma^2) 
\]</span>
where the index ranges are <span class="math inline">\(i=1,\ldots,n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(i=1,\ldots,m\)</span>,
<span class="math inline">\(\mu_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mu_2\)</span> are the mean speeds of the red and blue cars
respectively, and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span> is a common
variance parameter.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Let’s take a hypothesis test of the form
<span class="math display">\[
H_0 \colon \mu_1 = \mu_2 \qquad \mbox{versus} \qquad H_1 \colon \mu_1 &gt; \mu_2  
\]</span>
where we have chosen a one sided alternative to indicate our prior
belief that red cars are faster than blue cars.</p>
<p><strong>Steph</strong>: What that <em>means</em> is we have a conservative belief that, eh, maybe our two types of cars have the same average speed. This is the <em>null hypothesis</em>, the thing we’re beating up against. We’re going to test that against the <em>alternative hypothesis</em> that actually the red cars are faster on average. We choose to test that they are faster, because that’s the hypothesis we identified earlier with John’s sister in law: <em>red cars are faster</em>.</p>
<p>If we wanted to see if red cars were significantly faster than
blue cars we could perform a <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> test using the
<code>tadaatoolbox</code> package <span class="citation">(Burk and Anton <a href="#ref-R-tadaatoolbox">2018</a>)</span>.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tadaatoolbox)

             print=&quot;markdown&quot;)</code></pre>

</table>
<p>And voila, we have a p-value &lt; 0.05. We reject the null hypothesis in favour of an alternative where red cars are faster.</p>
<p>We got statistical significance, which we’d expect because we set up our little universe that way. Fantastic, it worked like we thought it might! (Just not Steph’s development environment).</p>
<p><strong>Steph</strong>: But the problem is we <em>know</em> that the colour of the car does not make for a fast car. The hypothesis test is performed correctly, under perfect conditions - but our understanding of causality is totally flawed and as a consequence it’s entirely misleading.</p>
<p><strong>John</strong>: Exactly. But statistics is about making inferences into a broader population. We had one caryard in our little facsimile of reality. We really need to understand if this could happen more than once - if it’s a generalisable result. Otherwise it’s just an interesting anomaly.</p>
<p><strong>Steph</strong>: Always with the generalising. But I agree. Interesting anomalies are rarely any use to me in the field or in the corporate world. I would need to understand whether this test is fundamentally broken, for all the cars. Or if it’s a fluke.</p>
</div>
<div id="reproducibility-prediction-and-inference" class="section level1">
<h1>Reproducibility, prediction and inference</h1>
<p>Suppose that we went to a number of “car yards” (i.e., repeated the
experiment) where data was generated using the above process and we
<strong>only</strong> observed:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the speed of the cars and the</p></li>
<li><p>the colour of the cars.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Suppose that we repeated the experiment 1000 times, that is we went to 1000 car yards<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> and performed the same two sample t-test on different collected
samples at each car yard collecting data for <span class="math inline">\(n=50\)</span> different cars
each time.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<p>How often would red cars be significantly faster than blue car
if we were to repeat the same experiment over and over again,
i.e., would our results be reproducible?</p>
<pre class="r"><code>n_car_yards &lt;- 1000 

p_values &lt;- c()

}</code></pre>
<p>From the above simulations we find that in 94.1 percent
of simulations where red cars were statistically significantly faster than blue cars
even though the colour of the car has nothing to do with the speed of the car. This is a generalisable result, not a fluke.</p>
<p>So…</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Reproducibility</strong>: The results would be reproducible roughly
94.1 percent of the time since
if we went from car yard to car yard red cars would be generally faster
than blue cars. <em>Pre-registration does not inherently solve this problem of a <em>spurious relationship</em> between these variables.</em></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Prediction</strong>: Even though there is no direct relationship
between speed and car colour, if we were to pick a car that we wanted
to be fast then we would pick a red car and the car would be more likely to be
faster than if we picked a blue car.
We can still make good predictions from incorrect models.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Truth</strong>: Painting our car red would not make it any faster.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steph</strong>: Congratulations John, statistics has discovered the age-old econometric problem of the spurious regression. We broke that hypothesis because we were measuring the wrong relationships.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>
<p><strong>John</strong>: Yes, that was my point - with a relateable example. It occurs all the time
in science. Researchers don’t know what the true relationship between measurements
are so they</p>
<ul>
<li><p>measure what their current theory tells them what is important to measure;</p></li>
<li><p>measure what it is possible or convenient to measure; or</p></li>
<li><p>measure a whole bunch of stuff and hope that something they measure is important.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steph</strong>: This happens in business all.the.time. You think you’re measuring Thing A, when actually Thing B is what’s doing the heavy lifting and Thing B just happens to be correlated with Thing A. <a href="http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations">Tylyer Vigen’s site is full of examples of this in real life</a>, in those cases, <em>time itself</em> is the common Thing B. If you’re working with time series it’s often inevitable if you don’t recognise the impact it has.</p>
<p><strong>John</strong>: Stories for another day?</p>
<p><strong>Steph</strong>: Sure- next time let’s see what this idea of a <em>spurious relationship</em> would look like in a real-world data science context.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>On our Twitter post announcing this blog, Steph made a comment about a would-be podcast, except she and John are the parents of five young kids between them (not together, we hasten to add). Consider this the ‘could have been’ podcast.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>Australian slang for try.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>At this point, Steph attempted to compile this post for the first time. John, we need to talk about dependencies one of these days.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>Now I’ve had to make a version update to R itself, John. I’m just saying, if you ever had to put code into production…<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p>For the record, this proof is John’s but Steph had time to take all the math-speak away while trying to update all those dependencies. Y’all can thank me later.<a href="#fnref5" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p><em>Some maths help</em>: This is basically just choose your own adventure, but for probability. The subscript <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> just refers to a specific, generic car - it could be anything, red or blue, sport a normal soccer mum mobile full of junk.<a href="#fnref6" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p><em>Some maths help</em>: These are what we call <em>conditional probabilities</em>, the idea that if Thing 1 happens, then Thing 2 may be more or less likely as a result. This makes sense if you think about sports at all (neither John or Steph follow sport, but we hear that normal people often quite like it) - the probability of team A winning the sportsball grandfinal might be 50% overall. This is the <em>marginal</em> probability. But the probability that Team A wins the sportsball grandfinal <em>given</em> Team B’s star player mysteriously won free first class tickets to Las Vegas may be 90%. This is the <em>conditional</em> probability. We signify that with the | sign - so <span class="math inline">\(P(thing 1 | thing 2)\)</span> means ‘the probability of thing 1 happening, given thing 2 happens as well’.<a href="#fnref7" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn8"><p><em>Some maths help</em>: This is clearly another fantasy, a simplifying assumption. Using this we can start placing numbers on our facsimile of the real world, measure the effects and then proceed to our test.<a href="#fnref8" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn9"><p><em>Some maths help</em>: The <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> function is what’s called an <em>indicator</em> function. It’s equal to a 1 if the condition inside the bracket is true and a zero if it’s not. So the speed of the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>th car is <span class="math inline">\(150 + \varepsilon_i\)</span> if it’s a sports car, but if it’s just a normal, rather dirty car full of empty happy meal boxes, it’s <span class="math inline">\(100 + \varepsilon_i\)</span><a href="#fnref9" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn10"><p>For those of you following along on this epic adventure, Steph is now reinstalling the entire <code>tidyverse</code>. On a mobile phone hotspot.<a href="#fnref10" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn11"><p>Am now reinstalling all dependencies of ggplot2, we better break something real good, John.<a href="#fnref11" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn12"><p><em>Some maths help</em>: those <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>s and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>s you can really just think of as a list of all the relevant points. Or, even better - they’re just two columns in a spreadsheet, one marked “red cars” the other is marked “blue cars”. The <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and the <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> just refers to the length of each of those columns. They could have the same number of observations, or different. <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> could be 20 and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> could be 25. Or 200 and 250 or 20000 and 25000. The idea of the maths here is to generalise. Whenever you see mathematics like this, that’s all it’s doing - generalising to the point where you could throw any number in there at all.<a href="#fnref12" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn13"><p><em>Some maths help</em>: Yep, John’s generalising again here. All he’s trying to say is that the two car speeds could have any mean, but they have a common variance. So they have the same <em>shape</em> of the bell curve, but it’s sitting in a different spot. If you’re wondering what that might look like, <a href="https://rexanalytics.shinyapps.io/mean_and_variance_app/">check out this app</a>.<a href="#fnref13" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn14"><p>As a corporate data scientist who is currently working through dependency hell, I legit use these tests all.the.time.<a href="#fnref14" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn15"><p>Steph would prefer to stab herself in the hand with a fork than do this, just saying.<a href="#fnref15" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn16"><p>The idea here is that we have very little certainty about one observation, one car yard, but about many observations we can be <em>more</em> certain. And if anybody has any idea why this build is <em>Failed with error: ‘package ’ggplot2’ could not be loaded’</em>, I’d be eternally grateful.<a href="#fnref16" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn17"><p>Steph’s note: Alot of seriously good field work is based around understanding this, working within the limitations it creates <em>and acknowledging these</em>. But understanding the domain is always critical to doing this successfully.<a href="#fnref17" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn18"><p>I admit defeat, can’t work out the dependency issue, John hit me up with your dependencies and system environment please!<a href="#fnref18" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
