      <description>Intended level and assumed knowledge: We figure you know a little about probability, a little about R, a little about hypothesis testing and statistics. We’d like to show you how these fit together. If you’re unfamiliar with these concepts, the footnotes will be your guide (some of the time).
And so it begins.. Our location: an office somewhere in Sydney, Australia. It might be well-appointed corporate digs, a slightly underfunded academic building or a cheap cafe somewhere in central Sydney.</description>

      <description>Intro Banter John: Where do you want to start Steph?
Steph: I don’t know John. How about we start with something that everyone reading this is probably familiar with? Did you want to do some \(p\)-value bashing?
John: Yeah, there are some Bayesians out there who refuse to do hypothesis testing on principal.
Steph: There is a lot of talk about reproducibility, replicability, robustness, and practices that lead to finding “truth” in the context of scientific practice.</description>
