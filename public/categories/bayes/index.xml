      <description>To whom it may concern,
Hi! We’re The Bayesian and The Frequentist. An academic statistician and a corporate data scientist. Two very different people doing two very different jobs with very different opinions on lots of things. We’ll try to play nice.
We’ve started this blog because there’s something we want to add to the conversation about data science. We’d like to add to our readers’ understanding of what’s going on under the hood of their statistical and data science practices∂.</description>
