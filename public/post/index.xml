      <description>Hi, we’re John and Steph and together we form “The Bayesian and The Frequentist”.
 As an academic statistician and a corporate data scientist we are two very different people doing two very different jobs with very different opinions on lots of things, but try our best to play nice.
We’ve started this blog because there’s something we want to add to the conversation about data science. We’d like to add to our readers’ understanding of what’s going on under the hood of their statistical and data science practices in an easy to understand manner.</description>
