<p><strong>John</strong>: Where do you want to start Steph?</p>
<p><strong>Steph</strong>: I don’t know John. How about we start with something that everyone
reading this is probably familiar with? Did you want to do some <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value bashing?</p>
<p><strong>John</strong>: Yeah, there are some Bayesians out there who refuse to do hypothesis
testing on principal.</p>
<p><strong>Steph</strong>: There is a lot of talk about reproducibility, replicability, robustness,
and practices that lead to finding “truth” in the context of scientific practice.
These issues also com
It might be a good place to start.</p>
<p><strong>John</strong>: So what do you think</p>
<p><strong>John</strong>: So a few years ago my wife was rear-ended while driving and the
car was written off so we needed to buy a new car. While we were looking to
get a new car my sister in law asked is (as a joke) “Are you getting a red car?
I heard their fast!”</p>

<h1>Case 1: Extra Sensory Perception</h1>
<p>We now consider a second example described by Sprenger (2013).</p>
<p><strong>Sprenger’s example:</strong> Jahn (1987) used electronic and quantum-mechanical
random event generators with visual feedback; the subject with alleged
psychokinetic ability tries to “influence” the generator. The number of
“successes” in this experiment was <span class="math inline">\(s=52,263,470\)</span> and the number of trials
was <span class="math inline">\(n=104,490,000\)</span>.</p>
<p>Assuming independence of each trial we have
<span class="math display">\[
x_i|\rho \sim \mbox{Bernoulli}(\rho), 
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(1\le i\le n\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(p\in[0,1]\)</span>.</p>
<p>If we perform the test
<span class="math display">\[
H_0\colon \rho=0.5 \qquad \mbox{versus} \qquad H_1\colon \rho\ne 0.5,
\]</span></p>
<p>then a rejection of <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> leads to evidence that the subject has psychokinetic
ability. Using the data a classical hypothesis testing approach leads to a
<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value approximately equal to <span class="math inline">\(0.0003\)</span>, leading to a rejection of the null
hypothesis for the <span class="math inline">\(\alpha=0.05\)</span> cut-off. A 95% confidence interval for <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>
is <span class="math inline">\((0.50008, 0.50027)\)</span>.</p>
