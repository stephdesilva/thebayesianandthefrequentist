<p>The Central Limit Theorem underpins alot of statistics and modelling. Once you understand it, what it does and what it <em>doesn’t</em>, critically evaluating the models and methods you use becomes easier.</p>

<h2>When do people use them, it’s just a theory, right?</h2>
<p>First let’s start with a couple of situations where you may be using the central limit theorem without even knowing it:</p>
<pre><code>* Have you ever done any A/B testing? Have you ever tested the hypothesis that two means, proportions or variances are equal? These tests typically use the CLT to achieve the results they depend on.
* Have you ever run a regression model of some kind? A generalised linear model? Logistic regression? Our understanding of how these models are acting - our understanding of the uncertainty these models are able to mitigate- is based on the CLT.
* What about ensemble or model averaging methods? Guess which &#39;trick&#39; they&#39;re using?
* Confidence intrvals? Yep, those too.</code></pre>

<h2>What <em>isn’t</em> the central limit theorem?</h2>
<p>The most common misperception we hear is the idea that <em>“when sample sizes get big, all distributions go to normal.”</em> Put simply, if this was the case most statisticians could all take up new hobbies. We’ll show you why this isn’t the case.</p>

<h2>So what <em>is</em> the central limit theorem.</h2>
<p>So it’s central limit theorems all the way down. That’s right, <em>Central Limit Theorems</em>. There’s a whole collection of them, each relating to a similar but slightly different situation.</p>
<p>We’ll concentrate on the version I call <em>classic</em> but is actually the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem">Lindeberg-Levy Central Limit Theorem</a>.</p>
